## Rosary Program

For years I wanted to write a program to tell me the mysteries of the rosary.  I felt like this could be so handy to me.  Life has move on and I'm now a secular Buddhist.  I considered tackling this again after all this time.  I debate wether I should embark in such endavor.  I feel like something like this would be useful for someone somewhere.  This wasn't too hard to make.  Originally I had forked someone's code, but it was quite convoluted.  At the end not a lot was needed, looking at other similar programs I can see there's still mnore to do.  This is just a start.


I want to make adjustment for lent and Christmas season.
I'd like to ecorpoare some ASCII art posibly with the help of curses.  As ironic as that sounds.

May all being be at ease.
